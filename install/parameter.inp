d_Lz = 80.0         ! Size in z-direction (units of half the channel height)
i_save_rate1 = 90000 ! How many time-steps between state****.cdf.dat output (also spec files)
i_save_rate2 = 800  ! How many time-steps between writing to vel_energy.dat file (turb****.cdf.dat outputs every 100*turb_save2 tsteps)
i_maxtstep = 100000000   ! Max number of time-steps to run before stopping the program
d_cpuhours = 11.8   ! How long (real time) to run your simulation for (not a function of how many cpu's you are using)

d_time = -1.0       ! If d_time < 0 and io_save1 = 0 (fresh restart), then d_time = 0. If d_time < 0 and io_save1 >0, then it will read the time from the statefile state{io_save1}.cdf.dat. Else, if d_time>=0, it will set the time to be d_time regardless of whether you're starting from zero or not.
i_tstep = 0         ! If d_time < 0, then either tstep=0 or it is read from a state.cdf.dat file. If d_time >= 0, then tstep = i_tstep.
d_HYPO = 0.0        ! Hypoviscosity coefficient
i_PHYPO = 2         ! Hypoviscosity exponent
d_drag = 1.e-2      ! Drag coefficient
d_vdrag = 0.0       ! ?? If non-zero then can reduce drag from potential flow?
